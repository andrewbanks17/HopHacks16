# HopHacks16
This project was supposed to be named budget watch, but it was labeled at hophacks2016 for some reason. I probably was really tired when I named it.

Anyways, This project utilizes capital onces api to manage and interact with your budget. The pebble code works only on cloud pebble due to some global enums.
